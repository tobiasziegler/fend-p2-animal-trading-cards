			<p>Tapirs live in jungle and forest regions and will spend considerable time in and under water. Their flexible proboscis allows them to reach more fruits, berries, and leaves. Baby tapirs have striped and spotted hides for camouflage. There are five known surviving species -- Baird's tapir, Mountain tapir, Brazilian tapir, Malayan tapir, and the Kabomani tapir which was described in 2013 and is the first new tapir species identified in more than 100 years.</p>
